About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to sharing my personal experience with a freelance programmer. During our collaboration, I faced several issues that ultimately resulted in the freelancer cutting off communication and blocking me. My aim here is to document this experience in detail to help others make informed decisions and approach potential collaborations with this individual more cautiously.
